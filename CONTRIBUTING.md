## Branching Strategy

- **Main Branches:**
  - `main`: The production-ready branch.
  - `develop`: The branch where all development happens.

- **Feature Branches:**
  - Create a new branch from `develop` for each feature or bugfix.
  - Use meaningful names for branches, e.g., `feature/new-login`, `bugfix/fix-login-error`.

## Pull Requests

- **Creating a PR:**
  - Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `develop`.
  - Open a PR against the `develop` branch.
  - Fill out the provided PR template.

- **Review Process:**
  - All PRs require at least one approval from a maintainer before merging.
  - Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting a review.

## Code Reviews

- **Review Guidelines:**
  - Reviewers should check for code quality, functionality, and style consistency.
  - Provide constructive feedback and request changes if necessary.

## Direct Pushes

- **Prohibited:**
  - Direct pushes to `develop` are not allowed. Always use PRs for changes.
  - The maintainer will reject any direct pushes to `develop`.
