## üîç Basic Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. **Check Running Containers**

The first step in troubleshooting is to check the status of the running Docker containers. You can do this by using the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will list all the running containers, showing their container IDs, names, and other important information.

### 2. **View Logs**

Once you have the container ID of the Knotie-AI service, you can view the logs to diagnose any issues. Use the following command to view the logs:

```bash
docker logs -f <container_id>
```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID from the previous step.

The `-f` flag allows you to follow the log output in real-time, which can be helpful for monitoring the application as it runs.
