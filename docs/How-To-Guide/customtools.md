# üõ†Ô∏è Custom Tools and APIs

Integrating custom tools and APIs with Knotie-AI is straightforward. This guide will walk you through the steps required to add and configure your custom tools within the system.

---

## üß© Modifying `tools.py`

To add your custom tool:

1. **Open `tools.py`:** Open the `tools.py` file in your preferred IDE.

2. **Remove Existing Tools (Optional):** If you want to clean up the existing tools, you can remove them and keep only your custom tool(s).

3. **Create a New Tool Class:**
   - Define a new class for your tool. Below is an example of a custom tool that fetches pricing information:

   ```python
   class CustomFetchPriceTool(BaseTool):
       name = "PriceInquiry"
       description = tools_info["PriceInquiry"]["description"]

       def _run(self, membership_type: str) -> str:
           print('Fetch product price is called')

           # Set up the endpoint and headers
           url = 'https://kno2getherworkflow.ddns.net/webhook/fetchMemberShip'
           headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
           
           # Prepare the data payload with the membership type
           data = {
               "membership": membership_type
           }
           
           # Send a POST request to the server
           response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
           
           # Check if the request was successful
           if response.status_code == 200:
               # Parse the JSON response to get the price
               price_info = response.json()
               return f"The price is ${price_info['price']} per month."
           else:
               return "Failed to fetch the price, please try again later."
   ```

4. **Customize the Tool:**
   - **Class Name:** Change the class name as desired.
   - **Tool Name:** Update the `name` attribute.
   - **Description:** Provide a clear description of what the tool does.
   - **Target URL:** Modify the target URL in the `_run` method to point to your API.
   - **Data Payload:** Update the payload to fit your API requirements.
   - **Return Message:** Customize the return message to suit your needs.

## üìÑ Updating `tools_info`

After defining your tool, update the `tools_info` dictionary at the top of the `tools.py` file to include your custom tool:

```python
tools_info = {
    "PriceInquiry": {
        "name": "PriceInquiry",
        "description": "Fetches product prices of Gym memberships.",
        "parameters": {
            "product_name": ["Silver-Gym-Membership", "Gold-Gym-Membership", "Platinum-Gym-Membership"]
        }
    },
    // Add your custom tool information here
}
```

This dictionary is used by the AI model to decide which parameters to use when calling the tool.

## üîß Modifying `ai_helpers.py`

You are almost done! Just two more steps:

### 1. Initialize the Tool

In the `ai_helpers.py` file, find the following section:

```python
if Config.USE_LANGCHAIN_TOOL_CLASS:
    OnsiteAppointmentTool = OnsiteAppointmentTool()
    FetchProductPriceTool = FetchProductPriceTool()
    CalendlyMeetingTool = CalendlyMeetingTool()
    AppointmentAvailabilityTool = AppointmentAvailabilityTool()
```

- **Remove Unnecessary Tools:** Remove any tools you don‚Äôt need and keep only your custom tool. For example:

```python
if Config.USE_LANGCHAIN_TOOL_CLASS:
    CustomFetchPriceTool = CustomFetchPriceTool()
```

### 2. Update the `process_message` Function

In the same `ai_helpers.py` file, locate the `process_message` function:

- **Modify the `if` Statement:** Ensure there‚Äôs an `if` statement that matches the `tool_name` with the name you provided in `tools.py`. Here‚Äôs an example:

```python
if tool_name == "PriceInquiry":
    tool_output = CustomFetchPriceTool._run(params)  # Ensure params are passed correctly
    message_history.append({"role": "api_response", "content": tool_output})
```

This code calls the `_run` method of your tool when the AI decides to use it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Technical Complexity:** This process involves some technical steps and may require a good understanding of Python and API integration.
- **Future Improvements:** A more user-friendly framework for adding tools (potentially using LangChain) is in the works. Stay tuned for updates!
